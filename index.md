## About Me

I am Huamao Xie, currently a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science, Beijing Jiaotong University, under the supervision of Prof. [Ding Ding](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/7492/). Prior to this, I obtained my Master of Engineering degree from Jiangxi University of Science and Technology in June 2020, under the supervision of Prof. [Zhendong Wang](https://ie.jxust.edu.cn/info/1094/8176.htm). My research interests lie in cloud workflow scheduling, neural networks, and multi-objective optimization, with a particular focus on the integration and application of neural networks and reinforcement learning in multi-objective optimization. My goal is to develop efficient multi-objective optimization algorithms for real-world engineering applications.

## Research Interests

- **Computer Vision:** image recognition, image generation, video captioning
- **Machine Learning:** meta-learning, incremental learning, transfer learning
