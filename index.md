## About Me

I am Huamao Xie (谢华茂), currently a Ph.D. candidate at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University, under the supervision of Prof. [Ding Ding](https://faculty.bjtu.edu.cn/7492/). Prior to this, I obtained my Master of Engineering degree from Jiangxi University of Science and Technology in June 2020, under the supervision of Prof. [Zhendong Wang](https://ie.jxust.edu.cn/info/1094/8176.htm). My research interests lie in cloud workflow scheduling, neural networks, and evolutionary intelligence, with a particular focus on the integration and application of deep learning and reinforcement learning in multi-objective optimization. My goal is to develop efficient multi-objective optimization methods for real-world engineering applications.

## Research Interests
